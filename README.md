## Lane Detection Using Computer Vision algorithms via Hand Engineering. 
<p>This was the Project 1 of the 3 part project we did to understand how The Self Driving Cars Work. </p>
<br>
We Used various Computer Vision techniques to see how the Driverless Vehicle sees an Image and Processes it to navigate it self to be inside certain Region Of interest so Following the methods and steps  we Used </br>
<ul>
  <li>Step 1: We Captured the Image using a Webcam  and  collected the image</li>
